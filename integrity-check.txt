Data Integrity Check
As a TPM, ensure the data you're working with is reliable
This problem focuses on a simple data validation task.

Problem:
You have a list of dictionaries,
where each dictionary represents a network device.
Your task is to check for missing data.

Write a Python function check_data_integrity(devices)
that takes a list of dictionaries.
Each dictionary should have the keys 'device_id' and 'status'.
If a dictionary is missing either of these keys,
the function should return False.
If all dictionaries are complete, it should return True.

Example Valid Data:
devices_valid = [
    {'device_id': 'd-001', 'status': 'UP'},
    {'device_id': 'd-002', 'status': 'DOWN'}
]

Example Invalid Data:
devices_invalid = [
    {'device_id': 'd-003', 'status': 'UP'},
    {'device_id': 'd-004'}, # Missing 'status' key
    {'status': 'DOWN'}      # Missing 'device_id' key
]

Expected Outputs:
check_data_integrity(devices_valid) should return True.
check_data_integrity(devices_invalid) should return False.

Hints:
Iterate through the list of dictionaries.
For each dictionary,
use the in operator to check if 'device_id' and 'status' are present.
If you find any dictionary that's missing a key,
immediately return False.
If you get through the entire loop without returning False,
return True at the end.

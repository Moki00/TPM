Practice for your SQL interview by tackling these three problems relevant to a Technical Program Manager (TPM) role.
These problems go from foundational to more advanced and are structured to help you think about how to solve a business problem using a database.

1. Basic Metrics Report
A fundamental task for a TPM is providing accurate, high-level metrics. You'll need to count things, filter data, and group it by a specific category.

Problem:

You have a table named device_status with two columns: device_id and status (e.g., 'UP', 'DOWN', 'MAINTENANCE'). Your goal is to write a SQL query that counts the total number of devices for each status. The results should be ordered to show the most common status first.

SQL

-- device_status table
| device_id | status      |
|-----------|-------------|
| 101       | UP          |
| 102       | DOWN        |
| 103       | UP          |
| 104       | UP          |
| 105       | DOWN        |
Expected Output:

SQL

| status      | device_count |
|-------------|--------------|
| UP          | 3            |
| DOWN        | 2            |
| MAINTENANCE | 0            |
